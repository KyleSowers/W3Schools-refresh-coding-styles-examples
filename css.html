                <h3>CSS Introduction</h3>
                <p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</p>

            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                <br>
            <ul class="marginL40">
                <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
                <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or other media</li>
                <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why use CSS?</h3>
            <p>(To define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in displays for different devices and screen sizes)</p>

                <br><hr><br>

            <h3>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
            <p>(HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!)</p>
            <p>(HTML was created to describe the content of a webpage)</p>
            <p>(When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers)</p>
            <p>(Development of large websites where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process)</p>
            <p>(To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)created CSS)</p>
            <p>(CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!)</p>

                <br><hr><br>

            <h3>CSS Saves a Lot of Work)</h3>
            <p>(The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files)</p>
            <p>(With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of the entire website by changing just one file!)</p>

<!-- CSS Syntax -->

        <h1 class="tutorialTitle">CSS Syntax</h1>
        <div class="container-col">
            <h3 class="centering">A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</h3>

                <br><hr><br>

            <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
            <p>(The selector points to the HTML element you want to style)</p>
            <p>(The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons)</p>
            <p>(Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon)</p>
            <p>(Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces)</p>
                <br>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p><span class="darkred">p</span> { </p>
            <p class="marginL20">
                <span class="red">color</span>: <span class="blue">red</span>;<br>
                <span class="red">text-align</span>: <span class="blue">center</span>;
            </p>
            <p>}</p>
                <br>
            <p>(Example explained)</p>
            <ul class="marginL40">
                <li><span class="red">p</span> is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: &lt;p&gt; </li>
                <li><span class="red">color</span> is a property,  and <span class="red">red</span> is the property value </li>
                <li><span class="red">text-align</span> is a property, and <span class="red">center</span> is the property value </li>
            </ul>
