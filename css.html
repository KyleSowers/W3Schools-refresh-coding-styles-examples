            <ul class="marginL40">
                <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
                <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or other media</li>
                <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>

            <h3>Why use CSS?</h3>
            <p>(To define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in displays for different devices and screen sizes)</p>

            <h3>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
            <p>(HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!)</p>
            <p>(HTML was created to describe the content of a webpage)</p>
            <p>(When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers)</p>
            <p>(Development of large websites where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process)</p>
            <p>(To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)created CSS)</p>
            <p>(CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!)</p>

            <h3>CSS Saves a Lot of Work)</h3>
            <p>(The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files)</p>
            <p>(With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of the entire website by changing just one file!)</p>
